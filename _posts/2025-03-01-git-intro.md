**Git** is a powerful version control system that helps developers track changes in their code and collaborate with others.

---

## Why Use Git?

- Keep track of every modification to your codebase.
- Collaborate with teammates efficiently.
- Revert to earlier versions if something goes wrong.

---

## Installation

Install Git from the [official site](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and verify with:

```bash
git --version
```

---

## Basic Commands

```bash
git init                 # Initialize a new Git repository
git status               # Show current status
git add .                # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Message"  # Commit staged changes
git log                  # View commit history
git diff                 # Show changes between commits or working tree
```

---

## Working with Remote

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
git push -u origin main
git pull origin main
```

---

## Branching

```bash
git branch                   # List branches
git checkout -b new-feature  # Create and switch to new branch
git merge new-feature        # Merge branch into current
```

---

## .gitignore

Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude files/folders:

```text
node_modules/
.env
*.log
```

---

## Summary

Git helps you write better code by keeping track of your work and letting you experiment safely.
It's essential for collaboration and one of the most important tools for developers.
