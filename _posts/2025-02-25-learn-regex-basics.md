**Regular Expressions (Regex)** are powerful tools for pattern matching and text processing.
They're widely used in search, data validation, parsing logs, and more.

---

## What is Regex?

A **regular expression** is a special string that describes a search pattern.
It allows you to match complex text using concise syntax.

```regex
abc     # Matches exact 'abc'
\d      # Matches any digit (0â€“9)
\w      # Matches any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)
\s      # Matches any whitespace (space, tab, newline)
.       # Matches any character except newline
```

---

## Quantifiers

```regex
a*      # 0 or more of 'a'
a+      # 1 or more of 'a'
a?      # 0 or 1 of 'a'
a{3}  # Exactly 3 of 'a'
a{2,4}# Between 2 and 4 of 'a'
```

---

## Character Classes

```regex
[abc]       # Matches 'a', 'b', or 'c'
[^abc]      # Not 'a', 'b', or 'c'
[a-zA-Z0-9] # Any letter or digit
```

---

## Anchors

```regex
^start   # Match at beginning
end$     # Match at end
word # Word boundary
```

---

## Groups and Alternation

```regex
(grab|take)   # Matches 'grab' or 'take'
(colou?r)     # 'color' or 'colour'
(\d{3})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})  # Grouped SSN-like pattern
```

---

## Common Use Cases

### Validate an Email

```regex
^[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.\w+$
```

### Find All URLs

```regex
https?:\/\/(www\.)?[\w\-]+(\.[\w\-]+)+
```
