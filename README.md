# Wen0x0

Welcome to **Wen0x0**, my personal blog where I collect what I learn and share what I think.  
I'm **Tong Nguyen Quoc Anh**, but you can call me **Wen**.  
Just a student, curious about computers.

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme.
